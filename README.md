# SoundCloud-Widget

[Live](https://codicate.github.io/soundcloud-widget/)

Made with React, Redux, Typescript, and SoundCloud API

<br>

## Todos

### Fixes:
- Search bar select text is disabled. Turn that on
- Fetch more songs than just ~10, I know in SoundCloud have way more search result with the same input
- Replace .then with async await
- Move floating player states down into the component
- Typescript?


### Features:
- Add songs to playlist, and will play them in order
- Shuffle in playlist
- localStorage or Firebase to store playlist
- Multiple playlists and queue
- Fast forward and backward
- Miniplayer resizing


### End Goals:
  A floating miniplayer to add to any website. Draggable and resizable, with full music control. Right click to bring up search menu, log in, playlist, and queue. Save user info in account/localStorage. The app can be used for SPA with long dwell time, or personal SPA to play custom playlist on load for the mood. (Maybe there is a way for it to work in non-SPA and non-React website?)
